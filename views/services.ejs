          <h3>Mental Health</h3>
          <p>Mental Health is vital to your overall well being.
            <br />As life becomes more competitive, challenging and stressful,
            <br />we all need compassionate, practical support.
            <br />
            <br />We work with many different specialists whose skills are focused
            <br />
            <br />on addressing and helping patients struggling with their mental health.
            <br />
            <br />Just as we wouldn't ignore the needs of a patient with a
            <br />broken leg, we work with our patients to keep their minds healthy too.
            <br /> Most importantly, we do not want any of our patients to be
            <br />too embarrassed or ashamed to talk to us. <br />Mental health conditions<br />
            fester in isolation and <br />just like
            <br />an open sore, become more difficult
            <br />to treat as they worsen.<br />
            <br /> There is no shame in needing help.
            <br />Anxiety, depression, stress, OCD and eating disorders

            <br />are examples of conditions that we work with our patients to treat.
            <br />
